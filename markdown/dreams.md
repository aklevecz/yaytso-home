# Dream Therapy Sessions

Dream therapy, primarily associated with Carl Jung, alongside behaviorist principles coming from B.F. Skinner, offers a unique approach where dreams are analyzed, visualized, and used to inform behavior changes. This document delves into what you can expect during such therapy sessions.

## What is Dream Therapy?

Dream therapy combines elements from both analytic psychology and behaviorism. Analytically, dreams are interpreted to uncover the subconscious mind's workings, helping patients reveal their deep-seated thoughts, desires, fears, and anxieties. Given a behavioral approach, these dream interpretations' findings are then used to inform a behavior plan aimed at assisting the individuals in improving the feelings evoked in the dream.

## A Typical Dream Therapy Session

1. **Dream Interpretation:** Each session focuses on interpreting a single dream. The therapist and the client work together to decode images, feelings, and experiences from the dream.

2. **Creating a Visualization Using Stable Diffusion:** By applying the technique of stable diffusion, a dream's graphical representation is projected. This helps in transforming the abstract elements of the dream into a more tangible form.

3. **Formulating a Behavioral Plan:** Grounded in B.F. Skinner's principles, based on the feelings evoked from the dream, a behavior plan is created. This is aimed to improve the client's emotions and reactions by better understanding and managing the real-life feelings uncovered during the dream interpretation.

## Symbol Interpretation

Drawing from Carl Jung's psychoanalytic theory, symbols in dream therapy often have roots in cultural and mythological contexts.

Through the lens of Egyptian mythology, the falcon-headed god, Horus, embodies the concept of overlooking immediate hardships to see life's broader perspective. This symbolism may be applied if a hawk or falcon appears in a dream.

Similarly, the Egyptian Scarab, symbolizing transformation and self-creation, could denote the dreamer's need to modify their perspectives or beliefs.

The integration of such mythological symbols brings deeper understanding to dream analysis. However, personal interpretation is crucial in symbol analysis and should be managed with a seasoned dream therapist.
